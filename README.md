## Work from Software Design &amp; Documentation course


This is an event-scheduling program I wrote as part of a larger group project in Software Design &amp; Documentation. Given a set of events, a set of locations, and a timeframe, it builds a schedule such that each event is placed in a specific location at a specific time, with no location or event presenter overlap. The program utilizes a backtracking algorithm to populate the schedule with events.
